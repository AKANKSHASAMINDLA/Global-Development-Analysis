# Global Development Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **Global Development Analysis Dashboard** repository! This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key global development indicators, including **GDP**, **literacy rates**, **health metrics**, **sector contributions**, and **climate impacts**. The project leverages **Tableau Public** to visualize data from different regions and countries, allowing users to explore the correlations between various development factors.

## Overview
The dashboard consists of several key visualizations that explore global development trends. The following areas are covered:
- **Economic Indicators**: Visualizes GDP per capita, literacy rates, and sectoral contributions to the economy.
- **Health Indicators**: Explores infant mortality, birth rates, death rates, and net migration across regions.
- **Mobile Penetration**: Analyzes the distribution of mobile phone penetration and its correlation with literacy rates and GDP.
- **Climate Impact**: Visualizes the effect of climate on arable land and agricultural GDP across different regions and climate categories.

## Features
- **Global View**: Interact with global maps that show regional development metrics like GDP and literacy rates.
- **Economic Development**: Explore the relationship between economic development (GDP per capita) and sector contributions (Agriculture, Industry, Service).
- **Health Insights**: Analyze health indicators like infant mortality rates and birth rates, and explore the relationship between these factors and migration trends.
- **Sector Contributions**: Visualize sectoral contributions to GDP across different countries and regions, with specific focus on agriculture, industry, and services.
- **Mobile Penetration**: Understand how mobile phone penetration correlates with GDP per capita and literacy rates across various regions.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau Public**: For creating the visualizations.
- **Mapbox**: For mapping global and regional data.
- **OpenStreetMap**: For map data.

## Data Sources
The data for this dashboard has been sourced from various publicly available datasets. These include global economic reports, health statistics, and climate impact reports.

## Usage
- You can access the dashboard live on **Tableau Public**. [View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akanksha.samindla3090/viz/Global_Development_Analysis4/D1-Overview?publish=yes).
